The Highest level that is rendered is App which will include everything that is rendered.

At the top, we will have a navbar component, which has two buttons that direct to different pages, Home and Todo.

On the Homepage, I think theres something about weather.

Todo page: Row with input and button to add a todo. This would modify the list with the new todo and show it underneath the inputs.

Then there is the search component, which has a search bar that automatically updates the todo list with the todos that contain the search as a substring. So we will consider using filter and some tring methods.
